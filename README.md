# Real-Time Flight Status Board - Frontend Task

## Overview

This project is a **React-based application** built using **TypeScript** that mimics a real-time flight status board. The application fetches flight details from an external API, updates the data at regular intervals, and allows users to view detailed flight information.This app is responsive for all screen sizes. The application is fully tested and deployed using **Netlify**.

## Features

### 1. Flight Table

- Fetches and displays a list of flights in a table format.
- Columns include:
  - Flight Number
  - Airline
  - Origin
  - Destination
  - Departure Time
  - Status (e.g., "On Time", "Delayed", "Boarding", "Departed")
- Auto-updates flight data at a specific interval to ensure real-time status updates.

### 2. Detail View

- Clicking on a row (or a link within a row) navigates the user to a **detailed flight view**.
- Fetches and displays comprehensive data for the selected flight.

### 3. Navigation

- Uses **React Router** for seamless navigation between the flight list and flight details pages.

### 4. Error Handling

- Provides appropriate feedback to users in case of:
  - API failures (network issues, exceeded API limit, etc.).
  - Unavailable flight details.

### 5. Styling

- Implements a clean and **user-friendly UI** to ensure easy readability of flight data.
- Uses **CSS with class-based styling** for a structured and maintainable approach.
